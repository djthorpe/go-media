# gopi-media

This repository contains code for media (audio, video & image) support  and some example programs in the `cmd` folder.
The repository depends on golang version 1.12 and above (in order to support modules). For
Linux support, Raspbian GNU/Linux v9 has been tested and for Mac support, you will require
[homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to be installed.

## Satisfying Dependencies

For Mac, use the following commands to satisfy dependencies (ffpmeg 4.1 or above is required):

```sh
% cd gopi-media
% xcode-select --install
% brew install ffmpeg
```
