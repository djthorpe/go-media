# go-media backend API

The API plugin provides a backend media service through HTTP calls. It is a plugin to
the monolithic server [`github.com/djthorpe/go-server`](github.com/djthorpe/go-server) 
and as such the server needs to be installed in addition to the plugin. Instructions on how
to install the server and necessary plugins is described below.

This package is part of a wider project, `github.com/mutablelogic/go-media`.
Please see the [module documentation](https://github.com/mutablelogic/go-media/blob/master/README.md)
for more information.
